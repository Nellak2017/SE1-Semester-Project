# Project Activities
---
## Overview

For this Software Engineering Class, we are given a team of 4 people and a complex web application to code out. To handle this complexity, a 
project information folder has been created to make the project requirments, roles, schedules, and more, all very specific.

In this particular document, I describe the Project Activities at a high level. 
This is __not__ meant to be the source of truth for the Project Task tracking, it is derivative from the task management software our team will use in this project.
