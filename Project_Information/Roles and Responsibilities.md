## Leadership Roles

### Team-Leader

The __Team-Leader__ is overall responsible for keeping the team on track. Specifically, the team leader has these enumerated responsibilites:

1. Keep the team on track
2. Organize meetings and fill out the __Meeting Agenda Forms__
3. Make the Team Plans and Milestones
4. Ensure the Team follows the Plan
5. Ensure the Quality of the Work Product is passing
6. Be the representative of the group that also turns in assignments
7. Provide an updated __RAD__ for the team to follow

### Discord-Admin

The __Discord-Admin__ is the owner of the discord server we use to communicate with. The Discord-Admin has these responsibilities:

1. Provide a means of Communication for team members
2. Make necessary channels for more efficient information dispersal
3. Moderate the Chats, removing inappropriate content

### Scrum-Master

The __Scrum-Master__ is the team's facilitator. The Scrum-Master has these responsibilities:

1. Mentor the team through Servant-Leadership
2. Convert the Team Plan into actionable Scrum Sprints
3. Overall Manage all Scrum activities


## Team Roles

### Designer

The __Designer__ is the person who will make the look-and-feel of our application. The Designer has these responsibilities:

1. __Create a Standard Design system__ that our team will follow. Provide any documentation of it to others and inform all that need to use it, so our look-and-feel is always consistent. (To make a design system, use a pre-established one like MaterialUI) 
2. __Create all UI components__ using Figma. From the atoms, all the way up to the pages, adhering to the design system of choice. 
3. __Effectively Communicate__ to other team members the designs and what is expected from them. Specifically, the Designer will need to communicate with the _Implementor_ and the _Tester_ when the Implementor is trying to make the Components and the Tester is writing Stories for the Components. 
4. __Ensure Quality of Components__ the Designer must ensure the quality of each component made. Specifically, the Designer must adhere to all Functional and Non-Functional requirements set forth in the _RAD_.
5. __Help in the Modelling Phase__ everyone will help with the UML modelling and creation of the _RAD_ that preceeds the actual implementation of the _RAD_.

### Implementor

The __Implementor__ is the keystone holding the entire team together. The Implementor will convert Tests and Designs into UI Components using the Framework of choice. The Implementor has these responsibilities:

1. __Create UI Components__ adhering to the designs and design system, and such that it passes all tests (Unit, Integration, and End-To-End).
2. __Follow appropriate Design Patterns and Best Practices__. Unclean code is unmaintanable and will slow down our project time-line. 
3. __Effectively Communicate__ to other team members what they have implemented and if it is what is expected or not. The Implementor will communicate with the _Designer_ and the _Tester_ to get enough information to be able to craft UI components. 
4. __Ensure Quality of Components__ the implementor must ensure the quality of each component made. Specifically, the Implementor must adhere to all Functional and Non-Functional requirements set forth in the _RAD_.
5. __Help in the Modelling Phase__ everyone will help with the UML modelling and creation of the _RAD_ that preceeds the actual implementation of the _RAD_.

### Tester

The __Tester__ is the team's way of ensuring a high quality product is delivered with the proper documentation. The Tester will convert the specifications into a series of Effective Tests that cover most if not all possible Test Cases for UI Components. The Tester has these responsibilities:

1. __Write UI Component, Function, and Object Tests__. The Tester must write the tests such that when they pass the component should be Production ready.
2. __Draft documentation for UI components__. The Tester must use Story Book to document and visually test UI components provided to them from the _Designer_. They are also responsible for any other documentation that must be generated for functions, objects, or tests. 
3. __Effectively Communicate__ to other team members the Tests they have written to see if it covers enough test cases or not. The Tester will communicate with the _Implementor_ and the _Designer_ to get enough information to be able to write the UI Tests. 
4. __Ensure Quality of Tests__ the Tester will need to account for every edge case imaginable. The tester must also adhere to all Functional and Non-Functional requirements set forth in the _RAD_.
5. __Help in Final QA__ the tester will also assist in the final Quality Assurance at the End of the Project. The _Team-Leader_ and _Back-End_ will also be reviewing this primarily to ensure that the work products are production ready.  
6. __Help in the Modelling Phase__ everyone will help with the UML modelling and creation of the _RAD_ that preceeds the actual implementation of the _RAD_.

### Back-End

The __Back-End__ is an experienced team member who handles back end matters such as API requests, Content Management Systems, and Databases. The Back-End will convert the Persistence specifications from the __RAD__ into code that is accessable to the _Implementor_. The Backend has these responsibilities:

1. __Create and Maintain Backend objects__. The Back-End will spin up databases (referencing their Models they make before hand), create or use APIs and microservices, and use Content Management Systems if needed.
2. __Make the Backend accessible__. The Back-End will make the Backend accesible to the _Implementor_ so that the _Implementor_ may populate his UI components with Content from the Backend sources, such as APIs, Databases, or CMS.
3. __Effectively Communicate__ the Back-End will need to communicate with the _Implementor_ on how to access the Backend assets, and will also talk with the _Tester_ on how to test the Backend components. 
4. __Ensure Quality of Persistence Solutions__. The Back-End must ensure the reliability of the persistence solutions such as the DB, APIs, and CMS. The Back-End must also adhere to all Functional and Non-Functional requirements set forth in the _RAD_.
5. __Help in Final QA__ the Back-End will also assist in the final Quality Assurance at the End of the Project. The _Team-Leader_ and _Back-End_ will also be reviewing this primarily to ensure that the work products are production ready.
6. __Help in the Modelling Phase__ everyone will help with the UML modelling and creation of the _RAD_ that preceeds the actual implementation of the _RAD_.

## Meeting Roles

### Time-Keeper

The time keeper keeps the meeting within the specified time limits.

### Facilitator

The facilitator addresses the issues that the meeting is supposed to cover, and opens the floor for questions and feedback.

### Minute-Maker

The minute maker takes notes of the main points brought up in the meeting. __They must provide documentation of it__ so the group can submit it for their Homework Assignments.
